/*
 *  Ancestral class for objects in 'ashe' namespace.
 *  Icebank: Classes that are less important or being in development
 *  Fjord: Classes that are mostly firmly well-implemented and changes least.
 *
 *  StrongRune: Exceptions cannot be ignored and recovered.
 *  WeakRunes: Exceptions that can be ignored or can be fixed in runtime.
 *
 *  This distinction is for personality, status and positions of classes.
 *  Kind of debugging manner, more like coding artistry.
